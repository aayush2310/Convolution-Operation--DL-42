edges are cange in intensity.
We can have many types of filter and depending upon the values in the matrix filters are determined to detect the horizontal/vertical/slant edges.We dont need to worry 
about the values in the matrix because they will be initially initialised randomly and then through back propagation they will get set.
The values of filter behave exactly same as weights in ANN.
This is why CNN is so successful bcz. it is not relying on any particular filter,it makes its own filter depending on the problem.
In CNN,when our feature map gets prepared,then we apply relu over all the numbers in the feature map.

If I have multiple filters for (rbg) image then we will get the o/p which will act as i/p for the further layers.
