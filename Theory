CNN has first a convolutional layer then a fully connected layer.
The starting layers(convolutional) detect edges(primitive features)
Then the next layers(convolutional) combine these edges to form a picture which is given to the fully connected layer.

rgb image

in mnist dataset we have a (28,28) image and each grid represents a number between 0-255
0-black
255-white

2d matrix

the model will process 2D numpy array

coloured image-3 channels-red,blue,green
